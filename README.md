# Acheeww Meter üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Team 404


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Arjun K - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad
- Team Mate: Abhinav V R - NSS College of Engineering Palakkad


### Project Description
Acheew Meter is a quirky web app that let users record or upload their sneezes, measure the time until the sneeze, analyze its intensity, and visualize sneeze patterns over time with dynamic graphs.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sneezes happen every day but Did you ever think about the intensity,timing or patterns of your sneezing?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So we built a web app that records and analyzes sneezes and measuring the time until sneeze, rating its intensity and plotting them on graphs

## Technical Details
